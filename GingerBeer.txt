    There's lashings of Hugh's famous fizz all round on River Cottage Every Day


Hugh: "For this, you will need screw-top, 2-litre plastic bottles, which you have cleaned thoroughly using sterilising tablets."

Makes 2 litres
Ingredients

    ¼ tsp brewer's yeast
    225g caster sugar (180g was fine too)
    1½-2 tbsp finely grated fresh root ginger (I used a bit a little bigger than a cream egg then peeled)
			second attempt 40g for two bottles with skin on
    Juice of 1 lemon
    1 good tbsp honey

METHOD

    Add the yeast to the bottle* (see warning below). With a funnel, pour in the sugar.

    Mix the grated ginger with the lemon juice and honey.

    Pour the ginger mixture through the funnel into the bottle. Now fill the bottle about ¾ full with water, put the cap on and shake the bottle until all the sugar is dissolved.

    Top up the bottle with water, leaving a 2.5cm gap at the top, to allow for production of gas. Cap the bottle tightly, then place it somewhere warm. Leave it for about 48 hours. Once the bottle feels very hard and has no give in it, your beer should be ready.

    Place the bottle in the fridge for several hours to stop the yeast working. Once the beer is thoroughly chilled, pass it through a fine sieve and serve.

Warning

We advise you use plastic bottles rather than glass to avoid explosions. A really active mixture can produce lots of gas if left for longer than 48 hours, so do remember to let it off reguarly!
