400g strawberries

150g sugar

1 tbsp thick balsamic vinegar

2 tbsp lemon juice

--------------------------------------------------

To make the jam, rinse the strawberries, remove stalk and leaves.

Quarter large ones, halve medium-sized fruit and leave small ones whole.

Place in a medium-sized pan with the sugar, balsamic and lemon juice.

Stir until the sugar turns liquid.

Place over a medium heat, stirring constantly until all the sugar has melted.

Boil, stirring regularly in a figure of eight, for about 10 minutes until the jam looks thick and syrupy.

Test by placing a teaspoonful on a saucer.
Cool then push with your finger.
If it wrinkles itâ€™s done. If not, continue boiling for a few more minutes.

Remove from the heat and pour into a bowl to cool.
