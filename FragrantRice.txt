FRAGRANT RICE
1 cup basmati rice
½ dozen cardamom pods
1 teaspoon coriander seed
Method:
Over a light heat gently coat cardamom pods and coriander seeds in oil then add rice.
Add double amount of boiling water to rice.
Bring up to simmering point then steam till all the liquid has been absorbed. Test after 10 – 15 mins and when done fluff with a fork.
Place a clean tea towel between the lid and the pan until you’re ready to serve – this will stop rice from over cooking.
