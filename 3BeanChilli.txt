2 tbsp oil
1 large onion
3 carrots chopped
2 peppers seeded and chopped (or jar red peppers)
3 cloves garlic, crushed
2 - 4 tbsp chilli powder
2 tbsp smoked paprika
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tin kidney beans
1 tin pinto beans
1 tin black beans
2 tins tomatoes
1 113g tin green chillis or equivalent
1 100g tin tomato puree
125g mushrooms
300g frozen or tinned sweetcorn
1 tbsp dried oregano
2 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder
750 ml vegetable stock or beer
1 tsp sugar
salt to taste

When onion soft add carrots, peppers, garlic for 3 mins. Add chilli powder, paprika and cumin, for another minute. Stir in everything else and bring to boil and simmer for at least 20 mins - longer cooking tastes better, but don't let dry out.
