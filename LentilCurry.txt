225g lentils
1 medium onion
2 cloves garlic
2 fl oz cooking oil
2 teaspoons ground coriander
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons turmeric powder
1 teaspoon chilli powder
4 cardamoms (I usually grind these too)
4 cloves (i usually grind these too)
2 inch stick of cinnamon
salt to taste
100g desiccated coconut blended with 1/4 pint warm water in a liquidiser or carton creamed coconut or tin coconut cream

Wash the lentils then put in a saucepan with enough water to cover and cook gently until soft (40 mins?)- keep an eye on it so you can top up with hot water if it gets too dry - you want it quite sloppy.
Meanwhile peel the onion and garlic and slice thinly. Heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the onion and garlic. When they begin to soften add the spices and cook for 2 minutes.
Add the lentils and their cooking liquid. Stir rapidly to ensure the spices mix in well. Add a little more water if necessary. Continue to cook for 5 minutes. Add the coconut. Heat through and add salt to taste.
